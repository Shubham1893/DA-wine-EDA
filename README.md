# Wine Quality Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the wine quality dataset, focusing on various features that may affect the quality score of the wine. The dataset contains 1599 entries with 12 features, including acidity levels, sugar content, and quality ratings.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following packages installed:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Load the Dataset**: The code imports necessary libraries and loads the dataset from a CSV file.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv')
   ```

2. **Explore the Data**: The first few rows and the data structure can be viewed using:

   ```python
   print(df.head())
   print(df.info())
   ```

3. **Data Visualization**: The features of the dataset are visualized using histograms and heatmaps to understand the distribution and correlation between the features.

   - **Histograms**: To visualize the distribution of each feature, use:
   ```python
   import seaborn as sns
   for column in df.columns:
       sns.histplot(df[column], kde=True)
   ```

   - **Heatmap for Correlation**:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True)
   ```

## Data Description

The dataset consists of the following features:
- **fixed acidity**: Acidic quality of the wine.
- **volatile acidity**: Amount of acetic acid in the wine.
- **citric acid**: Levels of citric acid present.
- **residual sugar**: Sugar remaining after fermentation.
- **chlorides**: Salt content.
- **free sulfur dioxide**: Amount of sulfur dioxide that is not bound.
- **total sulfur dioxide**: Total amount of sulfur dioxide.
- **density**: Density of the wine.
- **pH**: Acidity level of the wine.
- **sulphates**: Concentration of sulphates.
- **alcohol**: Alcoholic content in wine.
- **quality**: Quality score given to the wine (0-10).

## Visualizations
The generated plots will help to identify:
- The distributions of different features.
- The strength and nature of relationships between features, particularly how they relate to quality.
